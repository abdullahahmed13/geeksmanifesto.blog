## $ whoami:
I'm **Abdullah Ahmed**, a passionate tech geek who enjoys exploring and speaking out loud about curiosities that keep me up at night.

I created **GeeksManifesto** as a space to document and share what I learn along the way, and last but not least to get me out of social media towards a more free technical presence.

## $ current interests:
- Hunting High and Critical Bugs on **HackerOne**, especially on Web and Android assets for fun and profit: https://hackerone.com/entropydrifter?type=user
- Developing freelance projects & Automation pipelines with Golang.
- Blogging and Polishing my writing skills.
