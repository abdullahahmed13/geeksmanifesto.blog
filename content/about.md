##  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Abdullah Ahmed**, a passionate tech geek who enjoys exploring and speaking out loud about curiosities that keep me up at night.

I createdÂ **GeeksManifesto**Â as a space to document and share what I learn along the way, and, last but not least, to help me transition away from social media towards a freer technical presence.

## Current Interests:
- Hunting High and Critical Bugs on **HackerOne**, especially on Web and Android assets for fun and profit: https://hackerone.com/entropydrifter?type=user
- Developing freelance projects & Automation pipelines with Golang.
- Blogging and Polishing my writing skills.
